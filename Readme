•	main.py: This script allows the user to enter an expression and evaluates it using the syntax tree.
•	syntax_tree.py: This module contains the implementation of the syntax tree and the evaluation logic.
•	Test.py/: You can provide your own test cases by creating text files with name Testcase{N} where N is {1,2,3.....}. Each line in the file should contain a separate expression to evaluate. The program will iterate through the files and evaluate each expression, displaying the result or any errors encountered.


Single Expression Evaluation
1.	Run the main.py script: python main.py
2.	Enter an expression when prompted.
3.	The script will evaluate the expression using the syntax tree and display the result.


Multiple Expressions Evaluation
1.	Place your test case files in the same directory of Test.py. Each test case file should contain one expression per line.
2.	Run the Test.py script: python Test.py
3.	The script will automatically read each test case file and evaluate the expressions one by one, displaying the results.
Note: Test case files should have a .txt extension and be placed directly inside the same/current directory.
